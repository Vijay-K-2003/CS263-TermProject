## Contact List & Splitwiser Terminal Application
### Doubly Linked List Data Structure
    ```
    This data structure consist of Contact data, previous pointer and next pointer.
    ```
### Insertion Algorithm
     ```
     DLL Node Insertion
     ```
### Deletion Algorithm
     ```
     DLL Node Deletion
     ```

### Search Algorithm
    ```
    Binary Search Technique to search a contact based on the initials entered by user.
    ```

### Updation Algorithm
    ```
    Search for the Name and replace Name, WorkContact and MobileNumber with the new data.
    ```
### Find Duplicate Contacts
    ```
    Use Hashset to check for duplicates
    ```
### Sorting
    ```
    Merge Sort - If auxilary memory is available
    Randomised Quicksort - Fastest execution on machine
    Heapsort - If there are memory constraints
    ```
### LRU Cache Algorithm
    ```
    Create a Deque and a HashSet. Set some capacity of the Cache Memory. Check in hashset for node. Then push into the list and hashset.
    ```
### Minimum Cash Flow Algorithm
    ```
    For bill splitting. 
    To minimize the cost required to deliver maximum amount of flow possible in the network
    ```
